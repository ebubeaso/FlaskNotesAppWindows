# FlaskNotesAppWindows
This is the Windows version of my Flask web application. This is a notes application that I have made using Python Flask for the backend, some HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the frontend and SQLite as the backend database. Included in this file are the instructions of how to download and install the Flask web application for a Windows computer. The file is called INSTRUCTIONS.txt, which you must follow in order to ensure that the notes web application will work for your machine. It will need Python to work, but fortunately I have included the Python web installer as well as the file that needs to be run to install the dependencies needed for this web application to work. You are free to modify the code used in this simple web application to make it your own. Enjoy!
